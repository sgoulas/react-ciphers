# react-ciphers

## Introduction

React ciphers is a personal project I put together in a week, where I display seven different ciphers and show how they dynamically encrypt / decrypt the user input.

## Technologies used.

1. `React` (^16.13.1 fully functional approach with hooks (custom ones too))
1. `Material-UI`
1. `Jest` + `react-testing-library`
1. `Husky`

## Deployed App

The app is currently deployed on https://sgoulas.github.io/react-ciphers/

## Acknowledgements

All cipher information (alongside the encryption / decryption functions) were taken from http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/.
