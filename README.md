1. `React` (^16.13.1 fully functional approach with hooks)
1. `Material-UI`
1. `Jest`
1. `Husky`

## Deployed App

The app is currently deployed on https://sgoulas.github.io/react-ciphers/

## Acknowledgements

All cipher information (alongside the encryption / decryption functions) were taken from http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/.
